## Load Libraries and Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


```

## Q-Q Plot

```{r}
ayurveda <- c(2, 3, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 7)  # n = 9
allopathy <- c(3, 4, 0, 6, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 0)  # n = 10

# Combine into a data frame for plotting
sick_days <- tibble(Group = rep(c("Ayurveda", "Allopathy"), 
             times = c(length(ayurveda), length(allopathy))),
                    SickDays = c(ayurveda, allopathy))

# QQ plots for each group
sick_days %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = SickDays)) +
  stat_qq() + stat_qq_line(color = "gray20") +
  facet_wrap(~Group) +
  labs(title = "QQ Plots of Sick Days by Group") +
  theme_bw()

```

```         
```

## Residual Plot

```{r}
# Calculate residuals from group means
sick_days_resid <- sick_days %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  mutate(Residual = SickDays - mean(SickDays))

# Plot residuals vs fitted (group means)
sick_days_resid %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Group, y = Residual, shape = Group)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Residual Plot by Group",
       x = "Group", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality

```{r}
# Test each group separately
sick_days %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(shapiro_p = shapiro.test(SickDays)$p.value)

```

## Levene's Test for Homogeneity of Variances

```{r warning = F}
library(car)

leveneTest(SickDays ~ Group, data = sick_days)

```

## Nonparametric Alternatives

```{r}
# Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Mannâ€“Whitney U)
wilcox.test(ayurveda, allopathy, alternative = "two.sided", exact = TRUE)

# Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test
wilcox.test(before, after, paired = TRUE, alternative = "greater")

# One-sample version: test if median differs from 120
wilcox.test(bp, mu = 120, alternative = "greater")

```

## End-of-Chapter Exercises

### Q8.

```{r}
# Simulated data
ayurveda <- c(rpois(16, lambda = 1), 7, 8, 9, 10)
allopathy <- c(rpois(17, lambda = 2), 8, 9, 12)

```
